# Python-Image-Converter


## This is a simple Image converter written in Python
The app is using PIL ,rawpy and imageio you simply put the convert.py in the folder you want to convert set the options 
and the app will convert all the selected files to png . I wrote this app to convert multiple image files
as fast as possible.
# Notes
The .psd files are converted to .jpeg format!!! 


# What files can be used
The app supports many image formats , EVEN RAW files! 
### DNG , CR2 , NEF , ERF , ORF , PPM , MOS , MRF , MRW and more!!!
Personally i convert a lot of .psd , .TIF and .dng files !!! 
### Before you can use it Install Image

* pip install Image 
* pip install rawpy
* pip install imageio 

### Example usage
* Copy the convert.py to the folder you want to convert
* Open the command line and go to the folder containing images you want to convert:
* Run the convert.py 
```
 git clone git@github.com:atufkas/angular-openweather-app.git [my-app-name]
 C:\Users\User_NAME\Desktop\Photos_for_conversion> 
 C:\Users\User_NAME\Desktop\Photos_for_conversion>python convert.py
```
 
The application will create a folder 'converted' where all your converted images are located!

And you are done!
