# Python-Image-Converter

## This is a simple Image converter written in Python
The app is using PIL , you simply put the convert.py in the folder you want to convert set the options 
and the app will convert all the selected files to jpeg . I wrote this app to convert multiple .raw files
as fast as possible.
